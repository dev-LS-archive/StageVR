Load "Tire_Burnout_Smoke.unity" for an example scene, or simply drag Tire_Burnout_Smoke from the Prefabs folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window. Duplicate the effect for each of the vehicle's wheels, then align each one so they sit in the wheel arches (see the example scene for the best location).

For the smoke particle effect to last longer then try changing the Start Lifetime setting in the Inspector window (the default is 4 and 6 for the min and max lifetime for each smoke particle). You many also want to tweak the Start Delay setting. For a constant smoking effect, simply ticking Looping.
